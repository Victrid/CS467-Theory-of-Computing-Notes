\section{Configuration of a Turing Machine}

\begin{definition}[Configuration] A configuration of Turing Machine is a finite string
\(c \in \Gamma^*\circ Q\circ \Gamma^*\).
\end{definition}


Start configuration: \(\mathbf{q}_{start}abc\dots\).

\(c\) is a tape with start position, which looks like
$$\cdots \square \square y_1 y_2 \cdots y_s \mathbf{q}_i y_{s+1} \cdots y_t \square \square \cdots$$
which means start pointer is pointed to \(y_{s+1}\) and current state is $q_i$.

Transition functions \(\delta\) then defines a function $\delta: \Gamma^* \circ Q \circ \Gamma^* \rightarrow \Gamma^* \circ Q \circ \Gamma^*$. (An extension is applied to \(y_i\) that the
non-existent component is defaulted by \(\square\).)

\begin{align*}
\dots y_{s-1}\mathbf{q} y_s\dots \overset{\delta}{\rightarrow} \left\{\begin{aligned}
&\dots y_{s-1}\mathbf{q'} y_s' \dots, & \delta(y_s, q) = (y_s', q', S)\\
&\dots y_{s}'\mathbf{q'} y_{s+1} \dots, & \delta(y_s, q) = (y_s', q', R)\\
&\dots \mathbf{q'} y_{s-1} y_{s}' \dots, & \delta(y_s, q) = (y_s', q', L)\\
\end{aligned}\right.
\end{align*}

\begin{observation}
\(\delta\) in this configuration definition is primitive recursive (with G\"{o}del Numbering).
\end{observation}

\begin{remark}
Here $\delta$ is infinite, however the rule set in Turing machine definition is finite. We use $q_{reject}$ to fill the function as rule set in the definition does not include rejection.
