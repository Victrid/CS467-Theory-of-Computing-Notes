\section{\texorpdfstring{$\mu$}{Î¼}-recursion}

\begin{definition}[$\mu$-recursion]
if $f$ is primitive recursive then it's $\mu$-recursive.

if $f$ is a $(k+1)$-ary $\mu$-recursive function, then $\mu f$ is the $k$-ary function defined by

$$(\mu f)(x) = \min\{i \ge 0 \mid f(i,x) = 0\}$$

$\mu f$ is $\mu$-recursive.
\end{definition}

$\mu$ is a partial function.

Ackermann function is $\mu$-recursive.

\begin{observation}
$A(3,4) = A(2, A(3,3)) = A(2, A(2,A(3,2))$
\end{observation}

Ackermann functions can be computed via a stack. Per stack operations are primitive recursive, and $\mu$ factor loops until the stack is reduced to $1$.
