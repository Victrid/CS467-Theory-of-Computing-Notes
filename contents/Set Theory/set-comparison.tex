\section{Set Comparison}
We have
\(\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,4,\cdots\}, \mathbb{N}_0 = \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}\).
Which set has more elements?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\mathbb{N} \subsetneq \mathbb{N}_0\), so \(\mathbb{N}\) is smaller
\item
  \(\mathbb{N} \overset{f: x=x-1}{\mapsto} \mathbb{N}_0\), they have the same size,
  just elements having different names.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Injective, Surjective, Bijective]
Let $A, B$ be two sets.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(A \le B\) if there is an \emph{injective} function
  \(f : A \rightarrow B\)
\item
  \(A \cong B\) if there is an \emph{bijective} function
  \(f: A \mapsto B\)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Injective} \(f(x_1)=f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2\)

injection means one to one function, which doesn't require filling the
image field.

\paragraph{Surjective} Any in the image set has at least 1 from source
maps to it

\paragraph{Bijective} injective \(\land\) surjective

\end{definition}
